# LeetCodePersonalSolutions
This is a personal path of utilizing what I had learned about python.

All problems are in folder of difficulity with number of question and name of the problem. This is for a easier checking if the discussion part of leetcode is kinda messed with solutions of other language.

Currently I am not yet working hard on proformance, as far as the code is accepted, I skip to next one for more quatity. Probably will work on code quality later.

In this case, many if not some of the problems are beyond my ability. IF I used an accepted code from discussion or other sourse, I will personally go through the code and write note for each part as a process of learning by complete understanding.

Due to the fact that I need to spend quite a bit time on ME major courses during semester, I am trying to do at least one or two problem through time to time, but I do get real busy from exams, labs and dues.

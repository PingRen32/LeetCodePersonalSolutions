# Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p),
# implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.
#
# '?' Matches any single character.
# '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
# The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
#
# Note:
#
# s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
# p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like ? or *.
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# s = "aa"
# p = "a"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# s = "aa"
# p = "*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
# Example 3:
#
# Input:
# s = "cb"
# p = "?a"
# Output: false
# Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
# Example 4:
#
# Input:
# s = "adceb"
# p = "*a*b"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The first '*' matches the empty sequence,
# while the second '*' matches the substring "dce".
# Example 5:
#
# Input:
# s = "acdcb"
# p = "a*c?b"
# Output: false
